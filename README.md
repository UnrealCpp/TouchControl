3d Preview By Touch Control Unreal 4.18

An empty project with a 3d object in it to simulate 3d Preview by blueprints. I was wondering if i can make a Kiosk program using unreal. I made an object that floats in air and turns in 2 axis. I had no touchscreen so "Use mouse for touch" is enabled in project settings. Its a little buggy but the concept is ready to use.

I will try to improve and add multi touch capabilities. My phone (CATs60) doesnt supported by Unreal so its hard for me to test things. I hope someone would help me out...
